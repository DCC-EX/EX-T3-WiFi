# Throttle Setup

> To manage locos, groups, icons & CS settings you'll need to be on the **T3 WiFi** display so the throttle website is accessible.

---

To connect the throttle to the CS you'll need to enter the WiFi settings, this is done from the **T3 WiFi** button on the main menu.

When on the **T3 WiFi** display you can touch any of the **CS Settings** labels to show a keyboard/keypad where you can enter the settings directly.

You can also connect to the throttles own WiFi and website (**AP Settings**) where you can enter the **CS Settings**.

## CS Settings
* SSID - The SSID of the WiFi network the CS is on *(Touch to show a keyboard)*.
* Password - The WiFi network password, if set *(Touch to show a keyboard)*.
* Server - The CS server address. This can be a hostname or IP *(Touch to show a keyboard)*.
* Port - The CS port *(Touch to show a keypad)*.

## Throttle AP Settings
* SSID - This is the SSID of the throttle WiFi.
* Password - This is the password for the throttle WiFi.
* http:// - This is the website address for throttle management.

For convenience there's a QR code which can be scanned by a smartphone to connect to the throttle's WiFi.\
The QR code can be swipped left/right to provide a different QR code which will open the throttles built in web page.

> If you don't have smartphone you'll need access to a computer with WiFi so you can connect.

When the throttle is connected to your local WiFi or you're connected to the throttles own WiFi you can load the management website. 

Open a web brower and type the throttle address.

If you still need to enter the CS settings go to the **Settings** tab.\
Depending on how you setup your **Command Station** you'll need to enter the **SSID** and **password** of your local WiFi or the **CS** WiFi.

* **If your CS is connected to your local WiFi**\
The **server** and **port** are `dccex` and `2560` by default, you'll only need to change these if you changed them on your Command Station.
* **If your CS is in AP mode**\
The server will normally be this IP `192.168.4.1` and the port will still be `2560` unless you specified a different one.

Click save to remember the settings, the throttle will now try to connect to the CS.\
If connection is successful the icons will update
