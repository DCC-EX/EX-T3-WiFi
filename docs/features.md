These are under the **Settings** button from the menu.

**Speed Step** - Can be 1, 2 or 4. This is the step value used to control loco speeds. *This is for the throttle only and not related to DCC speed steps*.

Some basic swipe gestures are supported on the throttle, Up, Down, Left & Right.\
Each gesture can trigger an action.

* **Keypad** - Show the keypad to select loco address.
* **Name** - Show the list of locos the throttle has configs for.
* **Group** - Show the loco groups the throttle has configs for.
* **Next** - If multiple locos have been selected then control the next.
* **Prev** - If multiple locos have been selected then control the previous.
* **Release** - Release the current loco.

> Locos are remembered in the order they were selected.\
So **Next** and **Prev** will follow this order.

The action to perform if a swipe action is set to **release**.\
If this is set to **Next** or **Prev** and there's no locos the throttle will go back to the menu.
