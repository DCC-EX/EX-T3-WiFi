Refer to [Throttle setup](/docs/setup.md).

# Managing Locos

Click the green **+** icon to add a new loco config.

<p align="center">

</p>

A window will open where you can enter the details of the new loco.
* Enter the loco address in the field with the **#**.
* Enter a loco name in the **Loco Name** field, this is just for your reference so can be anything *(Max 20 characters)*.
* The last option is a dropdown, by default a loco will have buttons for functions 0-28 but you can create re-usable function sets or have a custom function set per loco.

# Custom Functions

Each loco can have a custom function set.\
If you have more than 8 rows of buttons paging will be enabled and there will be 7 rows per page.\
Each row can have a max of 4 buttons.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/custom-fns.png" width="450">
</p>

Start by dragging in a row, click and hold the button with the arrows then drag it into the black area.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/custom-fns-row.png" width="300">
</p>

You can now drag in a button, click and hold the middle blue button and drag it on to the row.\
New buttons will use the next highest available fn #.

<p align="center">

</p>

Clicking the button will expand it so you can change the FN number and if it's a latching function or not.

<p align="center">

</p>

After making any changes remember to click the green tick icon so the changes are saved.\
If you've made changes you wan't to discard then click the red **X**.

For more advanced options click the icon to the left of the FN number.

From here you can set the button labels, colours and icons for **Idle** and **Pressed**.\
Clicking the icon circled in red will toggle between the **Idle** and **Pressed** states so you can preview.

> Click an icon to select it, click it again to deselect it.

<p align="center">

Rows can be dragged and reordered by clicking and holding the below icon that is at the end of each row.
<p align="center">

</p>
Buttons can be moved between rows by clicking and holding the dragging between rows.

> Remember a row can have a max of 4 buttons

# Function Sets

Reusable function sets can also be created.\
This is useful if you want to create a function set for a specific decoder that's used in multiple locos.

The function set name is for your reference.\
This will be the name that will appear in the dropdown when managing a loco as above.

Functions are created as per the instructions above.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/custom-fns-set.png" width="450">
</p>

> There's also an upload icon (next to the +) so if a new decoder function set gets added to GitHub you can upload it without needing to take the SD card out.

# Groups

Here you can create loco groups that will show when the **By Group** button is pressed on the throttle menu.

Each group on the throttle will display as a button.\
Pressing a group button will then list the locos within it.\
You can then press a loco button to control that loco.

To add a new group click the large green **+** icon.\
This will add a new blank group.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/group-new.png" width="500">
</p>

Enter a name in the `Group Name` field *(Max 20 characters)*.\
To add locos click the small green **+** icon on the group.\
This will open a new window where you can either enter loco addresses manually or select existing locos the throttle has a config for.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/group-loco.png" width="500">
</p>

Click the **Select** button to add the locos to the group.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/group-locos.png" width="500">
</p>

Locos in the group will be listed below.\
If the throttle has a loco config it'll use the name otherwise it will show as **Name Unknown**.

Locos in the group will appear in the same order on the throttle.\
They can be reordered by click holding a dragging.\
Loco groups can also be reordered by dragging.

To save on display space a loco group is loaded as collapsed by default.\
You can expand/collapse a group to show the locos by clicking the arrow icons.

# Icons

You can upload your own icons to use with the function buttons.

These need to be 24bit bitmaps with max dimensions of 30x30.
